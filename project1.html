                <p>Our goal was to create an app that people can use to connect based on similar interests, mainly
                     their plant-babies, share tips and tricks, brag about amazing finds and achievements and seek
                      help when in despair. And the main feature of this potential gem of an app - to meet up with 
                      other plant-parents to exchange existing plants to expend their collection.

                <p>Plant enthusiasts often face challenges in sharing their excess of plants,
                     gaining useful plant-related information and connecting with like-minded 
                     individuals. We have observed that the current methods for exchanging plants 
                     and plant-care knowledge are very limited and inefficient.
                    How might we improve the experience of the plant loving community so that our 
                    customers can safely and easily share plants in real life and information 
                    digitally? </p>

                     dating apps. And if your plant exchange preferences match, you can proceed with communication
                      about desired plant swap.
